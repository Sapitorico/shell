| **chmod** | modifies the rights of access to the archives |
| **su** | temporarily makes you a super user |
| **sudo** | temporarily makes you a super user, limited to only executing one command  |
| **chown** | change the file property  |
| **chgrp** | changes the ownership of the group |

Each file and directory is assigned access rights for the file owner, the related user group members and all others are assigned read, write and execute rights.
